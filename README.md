Hospital Management System - DB Design and Implementation
As hospitals develop, the need for a dynamic and flexible data management system becomes increasingly obvious. The recommended Hospital Management System, which employs both NoSQL and Relational databases, is designed to meet the unique requirements of modern healthcare operations. Considering the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, the hospital must remain at the forefront of deploying innovative solutions to enhance operational efficiencies and elevate the quality of patient care. The proposed idea connects two databases in a proactive manner to meet the evolving needs of our healthcare environment. The range of data utilized in healthcare is growing, including unstructured and semi-structured data such as patient-generated data, medical photos, and clinical notes in addition to standard organized data such as electronic health records. NoSQL databases ensure that our hospital is ready to handle the full spectrum of medical data by offering the flexibility required to manage this variability with simplicity.
